## 🔬 Research Summary
My research focuses on the **physics of semiconductor defects**, **thin-film deposition**, and **device characterization**. 
I specialize in correlating material microstructure (grain boundaries, phase changes) with macroscopic device performance (efficiency, sensitivity). 

This academic background provides the physical foundation for my work in **Yield Engineering** and **Computational Fab Analytics**, where I apply algorithms to solve the very defect challenges I studied experimentally.
