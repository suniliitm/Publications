## 🔬 Research Summary
My research focuses on the **physics of semiconductor defects**, **thin-film deposition**, and **device characterization**. 
I specialize in correlating material microstructure (grain boundaries, phase changes) with macroscopic device performance (efficiency, sensitivity). 

This academic background provides the physical foundation for my work in **Yield Engineering** and **Computational Fab Analytics**, where I apply algorithms to solve the very defect challenges I studied experimentally.

    * **Relevance:** Cu2ZnSnS4 and its alloy based thin film solar cells have shown better photovoltaic performance under Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions.
                     However, the effect of Cu-stoichiometry on the coexistence of kesterite (KS), stannite and/or partially disordered kesterite (PD-KS)
                     phases and their influence on photovoltaic performance is not clearly understood. Raman studies were carried out on Cu2xZn1.3SnS4
                     (x ¼ 0, 0.3, and 0.5) thin films.

                     valence band edge and explore the formation of ordered vacancy compounds along with absorption studies. Conductive atomic force microscopy
                     (C-AFM) studies were carried out Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) film deposited on Si and sodalime glass substrates to understand grain boundary physics.

### 2. OFET Sensors 
*My work on fabricating and characterizing active sensor devices for signal detection.*

* **"A spectroscopy and microscopy study of Parylene-C OFETs for explosive sensing"**
    * *IEEE Sensors Journal (2017)*
    * **Relevance:** In this paper, we have explored Parylene-C (PC) as a sensing material for its unique signature and selectivity for explosive sensing. We
                     have used a bi-layer deposition process to fabricate bottom-gate-top-contact organic field effect transistor (OFET) structures. Opening of
                     dangling bonds on subjecting PC to plasma oxidation (POPC) renders these molecules to be employed as a receptor material in sensing vapors
                     of both explosives and non-explosives, such as Trinitrotoulene (TNT), 1,3,5 trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane(RDX), etc. The change in:
                     1) the vibrational modes of the molecule by infrared spectroscopy; 2) surface potential of POPC by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM);
                     and 3) electrical characterization by I–V measurements of PC-based OFET on exposing to vapors have been systematically studied.

### 3. Material Integration & Thin Films
*My work on heterogenous integration of complex materials (PZT on Diamond).*

* **"Integration of perovskite PZT thin films on diamond substrate without buffer layer"**
    * *Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics (2012)*
    * **Relevance:** Integration of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin film on diamond substrate offers a great deal of potential for the application of
                     multifunctional devices under extreme conditions. However, fabrication of perovskite PZT thin films on diamond substrate without a buffer
                     layer has not been realized to date. We report for the first time on the successful deposition of PZT thin film directly on a diamond
                     substrate without any buffer layer using the pulsed-laser deposition technique. The perovskite phase was realized only under specific growth
                     conditions. X-ray diffraction and Raman studies confirmed the perovskite phase. The ferroelectric behaviour of the deposited PZT thin film
                     was confirmed using piezo response microscope phase image and ferroelectric hysteresis loop..

* **"Synthesis and characterisation of CuInGaS2 nano-ink for photovoltaic applications"**

    * **Relevance:** Focused on solution-processable semiconductors (Nano-inks) for scalable manufacturing.

* **"Characterization of tribo-layer formed during sliding wear of SiC ball against nanocrystalline diamond coatings"**
    * *Journal of Experimental Nanoscience (2014)*
    * **Relevance:** Tribo-layer formation and frictional characteristics of the SiC ball were studied with the sliding test against nanocrystalline diamond
                     coating under atmospheric test conditions. Unsteady friction coefficients in the range of 0.04 to 0.1 were observed during the tribo-test.
                     Friction and wear characteristics were found to be influenced by the formation of cohesive tribo-layer (thickness ~ 1.3 μm) in the wear
                     track of nanocrystalline diamond coating. Hardness of the tribo-layer was measured using nanoindentation technique and low hardness of ~
                     1.2 GPa was observed. The presence of silicon and oxygen in the tribo-layer was noticed by the energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping and
                     the chemical states of the silicon were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Large amount of oxygen content in the tribo-layer
                     indicated tribo-oxidation wear mechanism..
